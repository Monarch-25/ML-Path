So after stumbling here and there for quite some time (More like 1.5 yrs) I realised that although I wanted to learn ML but I lacked a certain drive
I'd make many excuses about the inadequacy of resources only to give up after few days of 'Intense motivation'.

I believe that I've matured enough during this period to realise my mistakes therefore so as to rectify my wrongdoings I would be devoting myself towards only a particular resource (which I'll be referencing after that completion of a particular task).
which surpsingly just turned out to be my college's programming club (yeah I feel like a moron for not recognising the gold near me only to look for silver elsewhere)


Task that I've completed:

1) learnt linux commandline (https://learnpythonthehardway.org/python3/appendixa.html)
2) learnt python (Data Structures, OOPs, conditionals, loops, lamda functions, Generators)
 -Basically enough that I feel comfortable enough to explore on my own.
